Welcome! I am a final year PhD student in the <a href="https://www.ebi.ac.uk/research/goldman">Goldman Group</a> at the <a href="https://www.ebi.ac.uk/">European Bioinformatics Institute</a> and the <a href="https://www.cam.ac.uk/">University of Cambridge</a>.

Much of my PhD has focused on modelling and statistically analysing small-scale rearrangments in human genomes. I have also developed deep learning-based tests for detecting interspecific positive selection that are robust to alignment error, and I have been involved in multiple projects involving sequence and molecular evolutionary analyses of SARS-CoV-2 genomes.

Previously I was at <a href="https://www.ncl.ac.uk/computing/">Newcastle University</a>, where I completed my masters thesis on the optimisation of sequences for DNA computing systems using multi-objective genetic algorithms.
